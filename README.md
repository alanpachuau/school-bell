# School Bell Using Raspberry Pi
This project is developed for School Bell with customizable music as the sound. We have a dashboard developed using Laravel 5 and Vuejs. This dashboard is responsible for configuring the bell settings and is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian installed. I am using external amplifier to play the sound, I need to turn it on right before playing the sound and then turn it off right after the sound. A relay switch connected to the Pi handle the switching on/off of the amplifier. This reduces noise output from the amplifier and also minimize energy consumption.
